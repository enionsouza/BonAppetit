# Bon App√©tit

## About

This web app was built as the Capstone Project for Microverse JavaScript Curriculum Module.
It was built upon two independent APIs:
- [Meal DB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php): data about meals
- [Involvement](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270): Microverse API to record the different user interactions (likes, comments).

Below a screenshot of the homepage is presented.
